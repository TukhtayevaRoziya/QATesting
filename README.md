# QA Testing

Quality Assurance testing is a process which involves much more tha n just checking a product functionality.

Letâ€™s take for example the following use case scenario: a product developed in a Waterfall environment. That implies having well documented System Requirements Specifications from which the QA engineers plan testing, write the test cases and scripts to automatically run the tests (if any).

When engineers finish developing product features, the QA engineers will perform the following types of testing in order to ensure that the product meets the standards (existing KPIs set by the company or the definition of done): functionality testing, load testing, stress testing, and performance testing. In some organization the QA engineers test the product documentation as well for accuracy and completeness.

In general, QA engineers document the test results in specific test reports based on the testing type.
